## About


This game is a part of the Udacity Front End Nano Degree. The project was created based off a fork from the starter code provided by the [Udacity Github.](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)

For more information about the Udacity Front End Nano Degree, please visit the [Udacity FEND website.](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
